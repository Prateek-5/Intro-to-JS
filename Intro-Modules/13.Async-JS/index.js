/*
    Javascript is a single threaded lang
    Javascript by default supports synchronous code execution
    Note:The above property of synch code execution works only to the piece of code natively known 
    to JS

    setTimeout,setInterval etc if we run JS in browseer they are JS run time features as in they are been provided
    by the DOM API they are not natively known to the JS

    Browser provides a run time and Node also provides a run time .Through browser runtime we can access the features of 
    browser API whereas throught the Node runtime we can access the features of the file system and operating system based API

    CallStack,Event loop and Event Queue
        Condition to start executing task from the ecent queue
            The call stack should be empty there should be no function in the call stack
            The global code should also be done
